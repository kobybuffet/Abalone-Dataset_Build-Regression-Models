Abalone Age Prediction

This repository contains a notebook demonstrating regression analysis on the Abalone dataset. Four models were developed and evaluated:

Simple Linear Regression (Predictor: Length)

Multiple Linear Regression (3 predictors) (Predictors: Length, Diameter, Height)

Multiple Linear Regression (including weight variables) (Predictors: Length, Diameter, Height, Whole Weight, Shucked Weight, Viscera Weight)

Multiple Linear Regression (Final Model) (Predictors: All continuous variables plus Sex dummies)
